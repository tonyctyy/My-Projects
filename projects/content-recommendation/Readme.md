# Content Recommendation System (CR)
This project is focused on developing an advanced Content Recommendation System (CR) that effectively captures and adapts to user preferences in dynamic environments. The project aims to address key challenges in CR systems, such as data sparsity, the cold-start problem, and scalability, through a combination of research, model development, and system implementation.

## Project Overview
### Problem Statement
The primary challenge in building a useful CR system is effectively capturing and adapting to user preferences in dynamic environments. This is complicated by issues such as data sparsity, the cold-start problem, and the need for scalability in processing large datasets.

### Objectives
1. **Study CR Techniques/Models**: Conduct a comprehensive review of existing CR techniques, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches.
2. **Research Common Issues**: Investigate common challenges in CR systems, such as the cold-start problem and scalability, and explore industrial solutions.
3. **Build an Interactive CR System**:
   - **Backend**: Develop a system that processes user queries and applies various CR models.
   - **Frontend**: Create a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
4. **Incorporate Extra Features**: Enhance the system with additional functionalities such as sentiment analysis and LLM extraction.
5. **Evaluate Performance**: Gather user feedback through UAT and simulations to assess the system’s performance.
6. **Refine Techniques/Models**: Adjust models, parameters, and structures based on performance results.

### Expected Results
- **Interactive CR System**: A fully functional CR system that processes user queries and provides relevant recommendations, with a user-friendly interface.
- **Research Paper**: A comprehensive overview of CR techniques, common issues, and performance evaluations, along with suggestions for future research.
- **Project Video**: A video showcasing the CR system and its key features.
